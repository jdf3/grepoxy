Introduction
------------

This program glues graphs together in all possible ways subject to
certain restrictions.

For now, all that is needed is a ``C``/``C++`` compiler.

Installation
------------

To install:

``$ ./build.sh``

This will install all programs in the ``c/`` and ``c++/`` folders.
